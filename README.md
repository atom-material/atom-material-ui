A dark UI theme for Atom that (kinda) follows Google's Material Design Guidelines. Best with [Atom Material Syntax](https://github.com/silvestreh/atom-material-syntax). (Mostly) works with other dark syntax themes as it uses syntax colors for the UI. Light themes work too, but doesn't look as nice.

Inspired by Mattia Astorino's [SublimeText theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme).

## Installation

Fire up a console and type:

`$ apm install atom-material-ui atom-material-syntax`

Or, inside Atom's settings select Install and then search for this package.

## Configuration

Atom Material UI supports different accent colors. To change it, go to Settings > Themes and click the cog icon next to the theme selector.

You'll find the color dropdown there.

## Screenshot

Here's the obligatory screenshot. The toolbar on the left side is a package named [Tool-bar-main](https://atom.io/packages/tool-bar-main).

Animated tabs! (these animations can be disabled from the theme's settings)
